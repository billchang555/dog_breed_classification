# dog_breed_classification

## Description:
Welcome to the dog breed classifier project. This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)! In this project, I will  build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the dogâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify whether it's human or dog.

## Libraries
- Pandas : reading and processing data frames
- Numpy : covnerting list to array , mathmatical conversion and calulations
- Matplotlib : visualization 
- sklearn.model_selection : making a linear regression model for prediction
- Keras : training CNN Model
- PIL : python imaging library

## Steps
1. Import Datasets
2. Detect Humans
3. Detect Dogs
4. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
5. Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds
6. Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
7. Write your Algorithm
8. Test Your Algorithm

## Conclusions
1. The model was able to reach an accuracy of 80.2632% on test data.
2. If a dog image is supplied, the model gives a prediction of the dog breed.
3. For more better results, the model can be trained by adding more layers to CNN network, increasing training time by adding more epochs and performing hyperparameter tuning, such as different combinations of learning rate, batch size or optimizers.
